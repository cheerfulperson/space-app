## Description

In essence, the projects asks the user for data - both physical and chemical. And then a machine learning algorithm predicts the temperature on the planet and its closest relative out there. Then it also renders a 3d model representation of the created planet.
We actually wanted to gamify it by making tasks - for instance, you would have to recreate a 3d model of mars by changing the various parameters on the screen. It would be like a puzzle to learn astronomy.
Indeed, this would be interesting for people who want to play around and discover the correlations between the different properties of the planet. The most interesting aspect is that they can see their creation in a visual way based on the parameters they change. Hopefully a project like this can inspire and intrigue people on the topic of astronomy.
